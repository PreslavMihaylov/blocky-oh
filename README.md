A Trading Card Game based on the Ethereum network

It consists of a smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum test network (Ropsten) and a client-side HTML/JS app, which communicates with the blockchain via the MetaMask web3 API.

The features include buying and selling cards from your deck (via the smart contract) and dueling other players (via a duel oracle, which is an off-chain application authorized to resolve duels in the smart contract).
